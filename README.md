# aws_cloudformation_stacks

AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that helps developers and businesses automate the process of managing and provisioning their AWS resources.

My repo contains several YAML templates for configuring;

1. An S3 bucket
2. A lambda function
3. An EC2 instance.
